Item Outlet Sales Prediction

Overview

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the sales of items (Item_Outlet_Sales) in retail outlets based on various attributes of the items and the outlets. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

Dataset Features

The dataset consists of the following features:

Item_Identifier: Unique identifier for each item

Item_Weight: Weight of the item

Item_Fat_Content: Fat content of the item (e.g., Low Fat, Regular)

Item_Visibility: Proportion of the total display area allocated to the item

Item_Type: Category to which the item belongs

Item_MRP: Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the item

Outlet_Identifier: Unique identifier for the retail outlet

Outlet_Establishment_Year: Year the outlet was established

Outlet_Size: Size of the outlet (e.g., Small, Medium, High)

Outlet_Location_Type: Type of city where the outlet is located

Outlet_Type: Type of outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket)

Item_Outlet_Sales: Target variable representing the sales of the item in the outlet

Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts Item_Outlet_Sales using the features provided in the dataset. This can help businesses optimize inventory, plan promotions, and improve sales strategies.

Approach

Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values (e.g., filling missing Item_Weight values).

Encoding categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Scaling numerical features where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.

Identifying outliers and anomalies.

Feature Engineering:

Creating new features such as age of the outlet.

Transforming variables for better modeling.

Model Selection and Training:

Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

Evaluating various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.

Model Evaluation:

Using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression models.

Visualizing model predictions vs. actual values.

Installation and Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your_username/item-outlet-sales-prediction.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd item-outlet-sales-prediction

Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model:

python SALES PREDICTION>IPYNB

Results

The final model achieves good predictive performance with the following metrics:

R-squared: [Insert value]

Mean Squared Error (MSE): [Insert value]

Visualizations of the results are available in the EDA and evaluation sections of the project notebook.
