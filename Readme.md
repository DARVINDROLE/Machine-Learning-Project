#            **Item Outlet Sales Prediction**

## **Overview**

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the sales of items (`Item_Outlet_Sales`) in retail outlets based on various attributes of the items and the outlets. The project is implemented in Python and utilizes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## **Dataset Features**

The dataset consists of the following features:

* **Item\_Identifier**: Unique identifier for each item  
* **Item\_Weight**: Weight of the item  
* **Item\_Fat\_Content**: Fat content of the item (e.g., Low Fat, Regular)  
* **Item\_Visibility**: Proportion of the total display area allocated to the item  
* **Item\_Type**: Category to which the item belongs  
* **Item\_MRP**: Maximum Retail Price (MRP) of the item  
* **Outlet\_Identifier**: Unique identifier for the retail outlet  
* **Outlet\_Establishment\_Year**: Year the outlet was established  
* **Outlet\_Size**: Size of the outlet (e.g., Small, Medium, High)  
* **Outlet\_Location\_Type**: Type of city where the outlet is located  
* **Outlet\_Type**: Type of outlet (e.g., Grocery Store, Supermarket)  
* **Item\_Outlet\_Sales**: Target variable representing the sales of the item in the outlet

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to develop a model that predicts `Item_Outlet_Sales` using the features provided in the dataset. This can help businesses optimize inventory, plan promotions, and improve sales strategies.

## **Approach**

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   * Handling missing values (e.g., filling missing `Item_Weight` values).  
   * Encoding categorical features using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.  
   * Scaling numerical features where necessary.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   * Visualizing distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.  
   * Identifying outliers and anomalies.  
3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   * Creating new features such as age of the outlet.  
   * Transforming variables for better modeling.  
4. **Model Selection and Training:**  
   * Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.  
   * Evaluating various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
   * Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.  
5. **Model Evaluation:**  
   * Using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared for regression models.  
   * Visualizing model predictions vs. actual values.

## **Installation and Usage**

1. Clone this repository:
   
   **git clone https://github.com/your\_DARVINDROLE/Machine-Learning-Project.git**
    
3. Navigate to the project directory:
    
   **cd Machine-Learning-Project**
   
5. Install the required dependencies:
    
   **pip install \-r requirements.txt**
    
7. Run the notebook or script to train and evaluate the model:
   
   **python SALES PREDICTION.py**

## **Results**

The final model achieves good predictive performance with the following metrics:

* **R-squared:** 98.67889 
* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** 96.78585

Visualizations of the results are available in the EDA and evaluation sections of the project notebook.
